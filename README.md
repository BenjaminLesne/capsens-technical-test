# Architecture

The [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) was used for this test.

The structure follows the [Bulletproof React architecture](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/tree/master), especially the [Next.js example](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/apps/nextjs-app/README.md).

# Design System

## Start Storybook

```bash
pnpm run storybook
```

# Disclaimers

## Pixel-Perfect Design

Figma uses a different rendering engine than browsers, so fonts and layout may differ slightly from the mockup. Your OS, browser, and display can also affect colors, contrast, and rendering.

As a result, the final site may not appear pixel-perfect on every setup.
